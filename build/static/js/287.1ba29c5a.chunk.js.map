Available HIV and TB services and policies do not provide for special emphasis on disability friendly services especially for Women with Disabilities (WWDs) but are rather lumped under the vulnerable populations. Even the National Strategic Plan for HIV and TB gives limited attention to disability. The relationship between gender, disability and HIV/AIDS is even not well catered for in the plan Gender inequality makes women more vulnerable to HIV, with women and girls now having the highest rates of infection in heavily affected countries. This is due to women’s deep political, social, economic, and sexual subordination, which is enshrined in culture and practice.
