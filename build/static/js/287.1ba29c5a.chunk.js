Lack of access to HIV/TB education, information and prevention exposes people with disabilities  to the same risk factors of HIV/TB infection as their non \u2013disabled peers.

The fact that there are no explicit HIV and TB interventions targeting people with Disabilities  and even where efforts have been made to address disability concerns, the interventions address a few categories. Available HIV and TB services and policies do not provide for special emphasis on disability friendly services especially for Women with Disabilities (WWDs) but are rather lumped under the vulnerable populations. Even the National Strategic Plan for HIV and TB gives limited attention to disability. The relationship between gender, disability and HIV/AIDS is even not well catered for in the plan Gender inequality makes women more vulnerable to HIV, with women and girls now having the highest rates of infection in heavily affected countries. This is due to women\u2019s deep political, social, economic, and sexual subordination, which is enshrined in culture and practice.
